# oop-lab3-qutesweeper
Qutesweeper is a Minesweeper clone written in Qt, featuring an AI that helps the player win the game. The game portion is my 3rd lab work, while the AI portion is my project.

The AI relies on both logical analysis and probability calculations. It solves Intermediate levels about 30% of the time, which is higher than a lot of human players.
